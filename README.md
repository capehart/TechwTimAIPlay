# Tech With Tim Play

I went through the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTMPwUgLZf0

This is my version of the code.

# Reference
## LLM Temperature
* Low temperature (close to 0): The model strongly favoring the highest-probability (most likely) word. This resultsin predictable, focused, and often repetitive output.
* High temperature (closer to 1 or above): The modelâ€™s output becomes more random,allowing for more diverse and creative responses by increasing the chance of selecting less likely words.
